How to run me:

dakota -i dakota_nls.in -o run.out > stdout.out | tail -f stdout.out

or

dakota -i dakota_nls.in -o run.out 



This case will run a calibration study to find the optimal value for a given input set in the file cal.dat.  

There are two design variables defined but only one is used.
