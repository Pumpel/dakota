This is an optimization case using a gradient based method with fork interface.
Here we use conmin_fcrg method and multi_objective_weight_sets (pareto set method).

The functions to optimize:
x0^2
(x1-2)^2



Attention, the two functions are independent.  
Compare this with the previous case, where the functions are dependent.
