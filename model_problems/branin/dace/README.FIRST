Here we run the DACE experiment, to do so:

dakota -i test.in

This will generate your experiment and will write a file named table_out.dat, in this file you have the values for the design parameters.  The value of the objective function is 1, because we haven't computed it yet.




To plot using gnuplot

reset
set isosample 40
#set hidden3d
set xrange [-5:10]
set yrange [0:15]

splot (y-(5.1/(4*3.14159*3.14159))*x**2 + (5/3.14159)*x - 6)**2 + 10*(1-1/(8*3.14159))*cos(x)+10
